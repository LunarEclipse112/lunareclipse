# Welcome! {-}

Welcome to my portfolio. It is a collection of different skills and projects to showcase what I can do and have done. Each page contains a different group of skills and stands alone in its presentation. This website is a work in progress, currently still very much in the beginning stages of being made.

## About Me {-}

I studied Life sciences at the university of applied sciences Utrecht (HU). Within my degree I specialized in bio-molecular research and data analysis and visualization. I am very passionate about biology, molecular life sciences and data analysis. A work environment where I can combine those interests is a dream job for
me. With my specialization in bio-molecular research and data analysis knowledge I can be a bridge between lab analysis and data scientist. 

After working for a little bit to gather some work experience I am looking forward to start a Master's program in either Bio-molecular research or Data analysis and bioinformatics. 

## Future additions {-}

In the near future I would like to add to this portfolio a page with information about my Metatranscriptomics project and some pages with RNAseq and Metagenomics pipelines and *in silico* research I have done in the past. I would also like to clean up the repository for the website as there are many redundant files there at the moment and previous projects now outdated or irrelevant.
