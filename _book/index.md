# Welcome!

Hi! And welcome, this is my portfolio. It is a collection of different skills I posses and a way to show what I can do in a data analysis context. Each page contains a different group of skills and stands alone in its presentation. Also good to know is that this is of course, an ongoing process.

## About Me

I am a student of the University of applied sciences Utrecht. I have great passion for biology, molecular life
sciences and data analysis. A work environment where I can implement those interests is a dream job for
me. With my specialization in biomolecular research and data analysis knowledge I can be a bridge
between lab analysis and data scientist. I am a transgender nonbinary individual, This means I go by
they/them (die/diens of hen/hun). Usually this isn’t something I place too much importance on, I just live my
life like anyone else but it might have some implications in the future regarding sudden surgeries. In case
this does occur I feel like my future employer or internship provider should be aware beforehand.
