# Welcome! {-}

Welcome to my portfolio. This is a collection of different skills and projects to showcase what I can do and have done. Each page contains a different group of skills and stands alone in its presentation. This website is a work in progress, currently still very much in the beginning stages of being made.

## About Me {-}

I studied Life sciences at the university of applied sciences Utrecht (HU). Within my degree I specialized in bio-molecular research and data analysis and visualization. I am very passionate about biology, molecular life sciences and data analysis. In my work environment I can combine these interests to break down and solve complex problems, allowing me to apply programming and laboratory analysis skills to create reliable methods of research or improve existing ones.

## Future additions {-}

In the near future I would like to add to this portfolio a page with information about my Metatranscriptomics project and some pages with statistical analysis examples (correlation and regression analysis for example).
