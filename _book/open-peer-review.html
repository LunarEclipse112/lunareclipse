</h3>
<p>The first article selected for reviewing is about the teaching anxiety, stress and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic <span class="citation">(Delgado-Gallegos et al. 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>It is an article that looks at the psychological changes among teachers that have changed from a school attending curriculum to a virtual classroom model following restrictions on face to face meeting due to the pandemic quarantine.</p>
<p>We will start by scoring the article based on a rubric which determines reproducibility and will allow for a quick overview.</p>

<p>Reviewing the rubric shows us the article is very professional overall. Their data supplied allows for later testing for reproducibility. Although to actually check for reproducibility we will need to write code to run the same analysis they did and check for any variances in the results, Because of this we can’t fully conclude the article in question is fully reproducible. If code was supplied this article would have been a beautiful example of reproducible research.</p>

<p>Now we are going to look at the code from an article that does qualify for reproducible research.

<p>What sets this article apart from the previous one is the possibility to look at the code used to produce the results from the raw data. All the raw data links and exact code is supplied with the article and thus allow for an <em>easy</em> reproduction of the research done. It is important to note however that the article doesn’t score perfectly on the rubric as seen above.</p>
<p>The code is found under the R file name and is distributed based on the function of the code in a few different scripts. The scripts are easy to read and very clear on the function. Every section has well defined borders and has short but clear comments on what the purpose of the chunk is. I would rate this code a 4/5 on first inspection. The only reason I don’t give it a full score is personal preference. I would prefer the different scripts to be simply in one script that is easy to run instead of reloading the data over and over again and having to change it every time, but that’s just me.</p>
<p>The first script (00_functions.R) defines a few custom functions: one to summarises some data and another function to compare case fatality rates and the age distribution between two groups.
The second code file (01_input.R) loads in the raw data, adds a column (i see a mutate() function being used), filters it and transfers it to a new .csv file for later usage.
The third script (02_analysis.R) modifies the data a bit more and runs some basic analysis on it.</p>
<p>I won’t go in to more detail about the other scripts as analysis of the research is not the purpose of this open peer review fragment. I will however try to reproduce a small portion of it in the following segment. Any changes to the code will be recorded as comments.</p>

<p>After looking at the code and plotting the first figure I can conclude the following. The code supplied is beautifully made and with only a very small change in file location it runs perfectly. This is what one means with reproducible research data.
I score the code of this research paper a 5 out of 5 for ease of use and it does exactly what it is supposed to without noise in between.</p>
